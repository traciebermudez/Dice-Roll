# Dice-Roll
This is a C++ dice roll game for two players. Players enter their names, roll a 20-sided dice, 
and the program determines if they score a critical success (rolling a 20) or a critical failure (rolling a 1). 
The program then compares the rolls and announces the winner, or declares a draw if the rolls are equal.
